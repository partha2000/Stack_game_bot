# Stack_game_bot
This is a arduino UNO based bot which plays the game of stack very effectively.

AIM :This is a easy project and aims mainly at demonstrating the movements of a servo motor.

WORKING: The servo motor is timed accurately to perform the range of motion which coincides with the speed of the game.
         The time interval can be found out by hit and trial.
         
Hope you like this project.
